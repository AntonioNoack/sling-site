# Apache Sling Website
This repository contains the content of the http://sling.apache.org/ website, which moved in September 2017 from
the Apache CMS to this JBake-generated site.

## How to build and stage the site locally  
Clone this repository, run the below Maven command, open http://localhost:8820/ and enjoy.

    mvn clean package -Prun-site
	
This allows	you to experiment with your changes before eventually publishing them.

## How to publish the website
Clone this repository and run the below commands or equivalent:

	# Build the site and review your changes
	mvn clean package

    # deploy the site
    mvn clean package -Ppublish-site -Dmsg="<describe your changes>"

The [ASF's gitpubsub mechanism](https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/git_based_websites_available) then synchronizes that content to [http://sling.apache.org](http://sling.apache.org), usually within a few seconds. More details about the publication process can be found in the [ASF Documentation about Project sites](https://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html).

We could automate this using a Jenkins job that's restricted to run on build nodes having the `git-websites` label, as done by [Apache PLC4X](http://plc4x.incubator.apache.org/developers/website.html).

Note that the publish-scm goal might fail if you add lots of changes due to [MSCMPUB-18](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSCMPUB-18). In that scenario you have to manually perform the git operations, see for instance [this file at revision 3e58fbd7](https://github.com/apache/sling-site/blob/3e58fbd768344d90185a2123ca30afb6ec4f9000/README.md).

## Variables in page content
Adding `expandVariables=true` to a page's front matter enables simple variables replacement, see the `pageVariables` map in
templates code for which variables are supported or to add more variables. A pattern like `${sling_tagline}` in page content
is replaced by the `sling_tagline` variable if it exists, otherwise a MISSING_PAGE_VARIABLE marker is output.

Please use a `sling.` prefix for new site-related variables in `jbake.properties`, to differentiate from JBake built-in variables.

## Other Apache projects using JBake 
It's sometimes useful to ~~steal ideas~~ get inspiration from other projects using similar tools, for now we know of:

 * Tamaya - https://github.com/apache/incubator-tamaya-site
 * OpenNLP - https://github.com/apache/opennlp-site
 * Incubator - https://github.com/apache/incubator

## JBake and other technotes
* Currently using 2.6.1 via the `jbake-maven-plugin`, see under `/bin`, docs at http://jbake.org/docs/2.6.1
* That version of JBake uses [Flexmark](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) as parser for Markdown and [Pegdown extensions](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown)
* The templates use the [Groovy Markup Template Engine](http://groovy-lang.org/templating.html#_the_markuptemplateengine), other examples are provided at https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-example-project-groovy-mte


## Useful scripts and commands
To find broken links use

    wget --spider -r -nd -nv -l 5 http://localhost:8820/ 2>&1 | grep -B1 'broken link'
